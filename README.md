Here are all the code for the submitted paper by Lilian Vanderveken to NPG

To reproduc the different figures, you need to reproduc some runs. In the following, we will explain how to get those data.

First of all, you need to extract the L100.zip file

How to reproduce the stochastic runs:

1. 'create_AR1_noise.py' creates the structured noise needed

2. When the structured noises are created, you can run 'create_vegmod_real.py' to get the stochastic run showed in the manuscript

How to reproduce the run with a decreasing rainfall:

1. Runs the script 'create_trans_run.py'

How to reproduce the runs with different value of diffusion coefficient:

1. Run 'time_param.py'
